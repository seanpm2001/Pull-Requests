# Pull Requests

`ü™¢Ô∏èüí†Ô∏è‚ÑπÔ∏è Information on Git pull requests by @seanpm2001`

## List 

[`General GitHub pull requests page (will show the pull requests of the current logged in user)`](https://github.com/pulls/)

**Todo:** List pull requests here.

## Archival process

The archival process is currently suspended, until I find an efficient way to also show commit data, alongside pull data (preferrably automated)

# Privacy policy

I archive my own GitHub discussions, pull requests, and issues. By default, I respect users privacy, and will not have your issue, pull request, or discussion archived. You have to specifically ask for it to be archived if you want it to be.
